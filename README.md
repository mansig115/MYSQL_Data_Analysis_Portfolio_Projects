**1 - Fraud Detection Analysis â€“ Synthetic Financial Dataset**

This project analyzes a synthetic financial transactions dataset to detect fraudulent activities and high-risk accounts using SQL and recursive CTEs.

Key Highlights:

-> Computed fraud patterns and rolling sums to track suspicious activity over time.

-> Identified accounts with large, consecutive, or zero-balance transactions.

-> Verified consistency by comparing computed vs. actual balances.

-> Demonstrates skills in SQL, CTEs, fraud analytics, and financial data analysis.

**I worked on analyzing a synthetic financial transactions dataset to detect fraudulent activities. The goal was to simulate real-world fraud detection using SQL and advanced query techniques.**
